I am currently a fourth-year at the University of Texas at Austin. I am studying Business Honors and Quantitative Finance. As a student I have been very interested in traditional finance, statistics, and advanced modeling. This is a collection of academic, competition, and personal projects that I have worked on over the past few years. The whitepaper is hyperlinked and if there is supporting code or datasets created those are linked as well.

In the past two years I have become very interested in alternative data creation and structuring. Finding unique ways to collect unstructured data and make it useable within structured models or forecasting procedures. These datasets, specifically the creation process, is the focus of the whitepapers below. Often these datasets are used in papers following. 


| **Project Name**         | **Completion Date**         | **Description**         | **Whitepaper**         |  **Code**        |  **Dataset**        |
