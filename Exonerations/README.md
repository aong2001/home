# Exonerations

This project utilized [this](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx) University of Michigan database of exonerations in the United States. The page is already structured like a data table so this process was quite simple. Each row is parsed through to see if it matches the static size requirements to be considered "data". If these requirements are met than the data is appended into the final CSV.
